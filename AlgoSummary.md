#Tree
Thinking:
Tree的题目dfs base case应该是null还是leaf？

binary search tree: 根节点的左子树都比根节点的值小，根节点的右子树都比根节点的值大
The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
